%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 released on September 14, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.7 that caused the
\Condor{shared\_port} daemon to leak file descriptors.
Also made HTCondor work better when some HTCondor daemons
are using shared port, but the \Condor{master} is not.
\Ticket{5259}

\item The \Condor{starter} lowers the OOM (out of memory) score of jobs
so the OOM killer is more likely to chose an HTCondor job rather than
an HTCondor daemon or other user process.
\Ticket{5249}

\item Job submission fails if X.509 certificates are advertised with EC2 
grid universe jobs.
Therefore EC2 grid universe jobs no longer advertise their access keys.
\Ticket{5252}

\end{itemize}

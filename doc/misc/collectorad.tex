  For example
\begin{verbatim}
  MaxJobsRunningVanilla = 401
\end{verbatim}
  identifies that the \Condor{collector} saw 401 vanilla universe jobs
  currently running at one point in time, and that was the largest
  number it had encountered.
  \Attr{<universe>} is one of 
  \Expr{Unknown}, \Expr{Standard}, \Expr{Vanilla}, \Expr{Scheduler},
  \Expr{Java}, \Expr{Parallel}, \Expr{VM}, or \Expr{Local}.
  There are other universes, but they are not listed here, as they represent
  ones that are no longer used in Condor.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!MyAddress}

\Condor{collector} daemon which is publishing this ClassAd.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!MyCurrentTime}
\item[\AdAttr{MyCurrentTime}:]  The time, represented as the number of 
  second elapsed since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970),
  at which the \Condor{schedd} daemon last sent a ClassAd update to the
  \Condor{collector}.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!Name}
\item[\AdAttr{Name}:] The name of this resource; typically the same value as
  the \AdAttr{Machine} attribute, but could be customized by the site
  administrator.
  On SMP machines, the \Condor{startd} will divide the CPUs up into separate
  slots, each with with a unique name.
  These names will be of the form ``slot\#@full.hostname'', for example,
  ``slot1@vulture.cs.wisc.edu'', which signifies slot number 1 from
  vulture.cs.wisc.edu.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!StartdAds}
\item[\AdAttr{StartdAds}:] The integer number of unique \Condor{startd}
  daemon ClassAds counted at the most recent time the \Condor{collector}
  updated its own ClassAd.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!StartdAdsPeak}

  \Condor{startd} daemon ClassAds seen at any one time, 
  since the \Condor{collector} began executing.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!SubmitterAds}

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!UpdateSequenceNumber}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdateSequenceNumber}:] An integer that begins at 0,
   and increments by one each time the same ClassAd is again advertised.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!UpdatesInitial}
\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!UpdatesInitial\_<ClassAd-Name>}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesInitial}:] A Statistics attribute representing
  a count of unique ClassAds seen,
  over the lifetime of this \Condor{collector}.
  Counts per ClassAd are advertised in attributes named by ClassAd type
  as \Attr{UpdatesInitial\_<ClassAd-Name>}.
  \Attr{<ClassAd-Name>} is each of \Attr{CkptSrvr}, \Attr{Collector},
  \Attr{Defrag}, \Attr{Master}, \Attr{Schedd}, \Attr{Start},
  \Attr{StartdPvt}, and \Attr{Submittor}.

\index{ClassAd Collector attribute!UpdatesLost}

\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesLostRatio}:] A Statistics attribute defining
  the floating point ratio of the total number of updates to
  the number of updates lost 
  over the lifetime of this \Condor{collector}.
  ClassAd sequence numbers are used to detect lost ClassAds.
